				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>I am an undergrad studying environmental and computer science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I am broadly interested in how humans can operate responsibly within our broader environmental context. In particular, I am interested in tools and models that help us understand, conserve, and restore ecosystems, especially through computational and statistical approaches. I currently work as a research assistant in <a href="https://leung-lab.github.io/leunglab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Brian Leung</a>'s lab, helping them build computational models of large-scale ecological phenomena to support decision making processes. My summer research project concerns invasive species modelling, and is generously funded by a Bieler Undergraduate Research Award. I will make my code available on my <a href="https://github.com/SamiSugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> once I have something interesting to show.</p>
