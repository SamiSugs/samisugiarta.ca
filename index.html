				<p class="text">
					I'm an undergrad studying environmental and computer science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I am broadly interested in how we can operate responsibly within our broader environmental context. In particular, I'm interested in tools and models that help us understand, conserve, and restore ecosystems, especially through computational and statistical approaches. I currently work as a research assistant in <a href="https://leung-lab.github.io/leunglab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Brian Leung</a>'s lab, helping them build computational models of large-scale ecological phenomena to support decision making processes. My summer research project concerns invasive species modelling, and is generously funded by a Bieler Undergraduate Research Award. I will make my code available on my <a href="https://github.com/SamiSugs" class="no_show_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> once I have something interesting to show.

					Before uni, I studied at Vanier College, where I graduated with two diplomas, one in Pure and Applied Science, and one in Jazz Electric Bass!
