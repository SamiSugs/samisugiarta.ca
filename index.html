			<p>I'm an undergraduate studying environmental and computer science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I am broadly interested in how humans can operate responsibly within our broader environmental context. I currently work as a research assistant in
			<a href="https://leung-lab.github.io/leunglab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Brian Leung</a>'s
			lab, where I am looking forward to conducting my own research project this summer.</p>
