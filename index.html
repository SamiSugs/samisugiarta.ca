			<!-- Body -->
			<p>I'm an undergraduate studying environmental and computer science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I am broadly interested in how humans can operate responsibly within our broader environmental context. I currently work as a research assistant in
			<a href="https://leung-lab.github.io/leunglab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Brian Leung</a>'s
			lab, helping them build computational models of large-scale ecological phenomena to support decision making processes. My summer research project concerns invasive species modelling, and is generously funded by a Bieler Undergraduate Research Award. I will make my code available on
			<a href="https://github.com/SamiSugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my GitHub</a>
			once I have something interesting to show.
