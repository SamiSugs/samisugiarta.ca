This is an ongoing project. I am building a personal site from scratch. Current plans are vague, but I am looking forward to learning. I have essentially zero experience with web dev, design, HTML, CSS, JS, etc. I am also using this project as a means to get familiar with git, for which my experience is also... limited.

To do:

- Make sure the site properly reformats for smaller screns

- Keep nice-fying things

- Write a script to update the song of the moment easily

- Give the blog page a template

- Write and publish a blog post

- Write a script to publish blog posts without having to go into the HTML manually (maybe...?)

- Learn CSS (ID, class, etc) best practices and apply them, the CSS isn't very pretty as is...
